# Mission

With the booming research in artificial intelligence, the community is welcoming every day many newcomers. A lack of mentoring and inclusive environment becomes gradually significant. Our goal is to welcome new researchers in the community and provide them with some guidance to contribute to Machine Learning research fully and effectively.
